HW3 Meshless/Meshfree Interpolation

Consider a domain Ω=[0,1]×[0,1]. First randomly generate 10 points within Ω. At each of these points, a data is given by 𝑓_𝑖=𝑓(𝐱_𝑖 ), for 𝑖=1,…,10, with 𝑓(𝑥)=sin⁡𝜋𝑥  sin⁡𝜋𝑦. (a) Find the approximation of 𝑓 at 𝐱_𝑘=(0.5,0.5) with 𝑐_𝑖=1 and compare the result with the exact solution by computing the relative error 𝜀_𝑟𝑒𝑙≡|𝑓_𝑘−(𝑓_𝑘 ) ̃ |/|𝑓_𝑘 |. (b) By varying the value of 𝑐_𝑖, how does error behave?

HW5 Following HW 3, estimate the numerical gradient at 𝐱_𝑘
